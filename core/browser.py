"""Getting past a Cloudflare managed challenge in a real, headless browser.

A managed challenge is solved by the widget's JavaScript, and its clearance is
bound to the TLS fingerprint and IP address that solved it: a curl_cffi session
can neither solve one nor reuse a clearance a browser obtained. So a challenged
request is re-issued from inside a Playwright-driven Chrome, which solves the
challenge itself, and the response is handed back looking like a curl_cffi one.

Two shapes of request are supported:

* **Navigation** (the OAuth authorize leg). The page is opened the way a user
  clicking "log in" would, and the first navigation that leaves the provider's
  domain — the redirect back to the station, carrying the code — is caught and
  never followed, so the station's own page cannot consume the code first. It
  comes back as a 302 whose ``Location`` is that target.
* **API call** (station endpoints). The challenge is solved by opening the
  endpoint with no credentials, whatever the request's method, then the real
  request is made with ``fetch()`` from that page, so it goes out with the
  browser's own handshake and cookies.

What a page can see of this browser was measured against the same Chrome run
headed, and only the differences found are covered, by launch options rather
than script: patching navigator properties from JavaScript leaves its own
traces (non-native getters, own properties), and new-headless Chrome already
matches its headed self on ``webdriver``, plugins, ``window.chrome``,
permissions, WebGL and client hints. What remained was the User-Agent, the
window geometry and the scrollbars. An interactive challenge's checkbox is
ticked with a mouse that travels to it.

Playwright is optional, and not in requirements.txt: the dashboard installs it,
and downloads Chromium, on request (see :mod:`core.dependencies`). It is
imported on first use rather than with this module, so an install made while
AstrBot runs takes effect without a restart. Without it, or without a browser
it can drive, every call raises :class:`BrowserUnavailable` and the caller
reports why.
